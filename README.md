What is OPA:

  The Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open-source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets us specify policies as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from our software. We can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. In kubernetes, OPA uses admission controllers.
